As well, it allows to have multiple sessions with a single connection.\nCommunication with tmux is by the use of two keys in the keyboard: Ctrl + b. That is called the prefix, and is the trigger to get tmux listen to what you want to do next: for instance create a new windows, or change between windows, etc\u0026hellip;\nWhen you are in the remote computer, type:\ntmux new -s s1  Then create another window:\nprefix + c  Name windows:\nprefix + ,  Now type other and press Enter\nMove to among windows:\nprefix + 0 prefix + 1  detach the session and come back:\nprefix + d tmux a -t s1  Disconnect from the computer and come back:\nctrl + d ssh mit tmux -a -t s1  "
