- What is RNAseq: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2949280/

## Software
- Docker: https://docs.docker.com/v17.12/install/

# Agenda

- 1:30-1:55 Introduction to _vim_ __handons__: modify files in the terminal (mandatory if you don't know this)
- 2:00-2:25 Best practices for RNAseq ananlysis __lecture__
- 2:30-3:50 Running an example in the local computer __handons__
- 3:00-3:30 Running an example in OpenMind cluster __handons__: you need to be part of the cluster

   - tsailab: Lorena Pantano
   
You are welcome to stay during the whole session even if you don't want to follow the _handons_ materials.

# Goal
