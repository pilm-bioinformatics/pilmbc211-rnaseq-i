[Docker](https://docs.docker.com) is a platform for developers and sysadmins to:

* develop
* deploy
* run applications with [containers](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)

The use of Linux containers to deploy applications is called **containerization**.

Docker is defined as a light containerization because it doesn't need to fully reproduce a machine to work.
