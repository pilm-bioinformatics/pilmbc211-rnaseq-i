## Important features of the editor

It has three modes:

* insert: to write/modify the content
* visual: to inspect/select the content
* command: to tell the editor what to do: save, quit, undo ...

## Quick workflow to create/modify files

In a terminal:

* type `vim file.txt` to create a file named as `file.txt`
* press `i` to enter in **insert** mode
* write `my first vim`
* press `ESC` to exit **insert** mode
* press `:` to enter in **command** mode to tell vim what to do
* type `wq` to *save* and **quit**

type `rm file.txt` to remove the file.
